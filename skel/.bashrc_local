# Local system config changes.
# This file is sourced from ~/.bashrc to make any local changes to the system
# environment that deviates from the default debian setup. The reason for this
# file is so that we do not need to edit any of the defautl system config files
# except ~/.bashrc. This means that the package maintainer's default config
# files can be installed without merging their new config changes to our
# local changes on package upgrades.

# First source any system wide local changes
[ -f /etc/bash.rclocal ] && . /etc/bash.rclocal

# Any further user specific local changes can be made here

# Source todo.sh bash completion and also set an alias for todo.sh
TODO_COMP=~/.todo/todo_completion
[ -f "$TODO_COMP" ] && source "$TODO_COMP"
alias t='todo.sh'
# Make auto complete also work for the alias
complete -F _todo t

# While we're at it, also make the sudo alias 's' auto complete
complete -F _root_command s
